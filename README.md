# Angel Perez's (AITBW) notes on all things CompSci

Hello world, this is a repo where I'll be documenting
my learning process with programming languages and everything in between. Feel free to open an issue to discuss anything found in here —or suggest something I could use for my studies.

## Currently studying

### Programming languages

* Elixir
* JavaScript

### Theory

* Algorithms
* Data structures
* Discrete maths

## Explained in a nutshell

* [Client/server-side rendered JavaScript](https://tomdale.net/2015/02/youre-missing-the-point-of-server-side-rendered-javascript-apps/) —[Tom Dale](https://github.com/tomdale) is someone I really admire in the JavaScript community and this article helped me grasp the difference between SSR/CSR JavaScript and their purposes

* [Concurrency vs. parallelism](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24684037/4844313) —the top three (3) answers are awesome to get these somewhat confusings terms right but the one I linked is, by far (or so I think), the best one

* [RESTful programming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming) —the top three (3) answers sum this pretty well

## Planning to study

### Programming languages

* Rust
* Scala
* Swift

### Theory

* Component-based architecture
* Component-based Rails applications (CBRA)
* Component-based software engineering
* Design patterns
* Functional programming
* Microservices
* Object-oriented programming —I know the basics, but I think I've been doing it all wrong and I want to go back to basics and take the _Red Pill_ and get it right this time.
* Progressive web apps
* Reactive programming
* Serverless architecture
* Service-oriented architecture
* Single-page applications
* Web components
